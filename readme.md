# Code expert solution

Solution to implement:

- We should filter the data first so we dont have too much data to deal with.
- Current === true
- Additionally we can also filter if we can at least read with student role.
- We can build a nested object with the root being the folder "."
- then we add the rest inside
- we print the tree

should we use recursion or iteration?
how to prevent issues?
what validations we have to add?
corner cases?
